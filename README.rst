This is the IMAP extension extracted from the PHP source distribution.
PHP versions after PHP 8.3 no longer bundle this extension.

This extension is no longer actively maintained or supported, and this
repository serves as an archive for it.

The documentation is still available as part of the `PHP Documentation
<https://www.php.net/imap>`_.
